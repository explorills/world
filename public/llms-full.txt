## 1. Overview

ONE World is the immersive metaverse hub connecting digital identity, virtual experiences, and blockchain economies. This game lobby interface serves as the gateway for players entering the ONE World multiplayer environment, providing seamless user authentication, real-time multiplayer chat, in-game marketplace access, and comprehensive game session management.

ONE World bridges Web3 and gaming, creating a persistent virtual universe where players can explore, socialize, trade, and participate in blockchain-powered experiences—all while maintaining true ownership of digital assets through EXPL Node integration.

## 2. Core Philosophy

### Open Source
Every line of code is publicly available on GitHub. We believe in transparency, community contribution, and collaborative development. Both the web lobby interface and game client assets are open for community review and contribution.

### Community-Driven
Built by people who love what they create. Every feature, every environment, every gameplay mechanic comes from listening to our community. We're not building for players; we're building WITH players.

### Fair Revenue Model
Unlike traditional gaming platforms where publishers take the majority:
- **45% to EXPL Node Owners**: Distributed proportionally to all Node holders
- **45% to ONE Creators**: Rewarding game developers, artists, and contributors
- **10% to Founders**: Team operational and development costs

Players and creators always benefit first.

## 3. EXPL Nodes

### What are EXPL Nodes?

EXPL Nodes are the foundational ownership units of the entire ONE ecosystem. Owning a Node is like owning shares in a gaming company, but better—you earn daily tokens AND receive revenue share from ALL ecosystem products including ONE World marketplace transactions.

### Node Benefits

Each EXPL Node provides:
- **Shareholder Status**: Across ALL ecosystem projects (World, Pump, Network, etc.)
- **Daily Token Emissions**: 171 EXPL tokens per day for 731 days = 125,000 EXPL total
- **Revenue Share**: 45% of ALL ecosystem revenue including in-game purchases
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on metaverse development and feature priorities
- **Exclusive Access**: Early access to new worlds, items, and experiences

### Supply & Distribution

- **Total Supply**: 1 million Nodes
- **Batch 1**: 12,000 Nodes (already distributed)
- **Batch 2**: 88,000 Nodes
- **Batch 3**: 900,000 Nodes

As the metaverse expands, Node ownership provides increasing value from ecosystem growth.
